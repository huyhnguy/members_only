## Description
This project shows a message board with levels of accessibility based on the type of user that is browsing the page. Regular users can post messages and view the message board but they can't see the authors or dates of any message. Users who are members can see the authors and dates of every message. Admins have the ability to delete messages. Viewers must sign up and log in to become a regular user, input the right passcode to become a member, and another passcode to be an admin.

## Passcodes For The Site
* Passcode to be a member: 1226
* Passcord to be an admin: abcd

## Why?
The purpose of this project was to focus on implementing authentication and security in an Express app. Some things I focused on:
* Using passportJS, an authentication middleware
* Using cookies to store user info and keep them logged in for their session
* Practice using MongoDB to store user info and messages for the app
* Using bcryptjs to secure user passwords with hashing and comparing hashed passwords
* storing private data such as database connection string and express session secret safely in a .env file
