# Why?
The purpose of this project was to focus on implementing authentication and security in an Express app. Some things I focused on:
* Using passportJS, an authentication middleware
* Using cookies to store user info and keep them logged in for their session
* Practice using MongoDB to store user info and messages for the app
* Using bcryptjs to secure user passwords with hashing and comparing hashed passwords
* storing private data such as database connection string and express session secret safely in a .env file
